<!--* INTERVIEW QUESTIONS: HTML IMAGE TAG -->

<!-- 1: How would you make an image responsive using the width attribute? -->
<!-- You can set the width attribute to a percentage value (e.g., width="100%") to make the image adjust its width based on the available space. -->

<!--? 2: How do you create an image link using the <img> tag? -->
<!-- You wrap the <img> tag with an anchor <a> tag and provide the href attribute in the <a> tag. -->

<!--? 3: What's the difference between relative and absolute URLs in the href attribute? -->
<!-- Relative URLs are URLs that are relative to the current page's URL. Absolute
URLs are complete URLs, including the protocol (http/https) and domain. -->

<!--? 4: Why is providing descriptive alt text for images important? It improves -->
<!-- accessibility for users with visual impairments and helps search engines
understand image content.
