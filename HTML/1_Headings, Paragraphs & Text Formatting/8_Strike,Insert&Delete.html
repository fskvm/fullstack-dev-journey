<!-- Example of <s>: Non-semantic strikethrough -->
<p>
    This item was <s>$50</s> but is now on sale for <strong>$30</strong>.
</p>
<!-- Explanation: The <s> tag is used here to show that the old price was altered, but there’s no semantic meaning of deletion. It’s simply for stylistic purposes (e.g., representing discounts). -->

<!-- Example of <del>: Semantic deletion -->
<p>
    The committee decided to
    <del>cancel the event</del>
    postpone the event to next month.
</p>
<!-- Explanation: The <del> tag is used here to indicate that the text was intentionally removed or changed as part of editing the document. Such information is relevant semantically. -->

<!-- Combined Use Case -->
<p>
    The previous product description,
    <del>This model is discontinued</del>
    , has been replaced with <ins>New stock is available now!</ins>. <!-- Insert text will be in underlined -->
</p>
<!-- Explanation: The <del> tag informs users (and screen readers) that the original text has been removed, adding semantic information alongside visual styling. -->
