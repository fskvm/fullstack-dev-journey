//*  Function - A block of code designed to perform a particular task making it reusable
//? in JavaScript - firstly, we declare a function definition, then we make a function call

//! In Normal function declaration, we can call the function before it is defined because of hoisting.
/* Function declarations are fully hoisted with their memory and definition allocated during the compile phase,
 while arrow functions and function expressions are hoisted only as variablesâ€” their names exist but the actual function is stored later at runtime,
 initially set to undefined.
 */
//! In Function Expression and Arrow Function, we cannot call the function before it is defined.


//todo  Function Call
discRoll();

//todo  Function Declaration
function discRoll(){
   let randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
    console.log(randomNum);
}

//todo  Function Call
discRoll(); // calling the function to execute it
