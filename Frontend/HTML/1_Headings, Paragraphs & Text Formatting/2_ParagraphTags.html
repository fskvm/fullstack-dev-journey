<!-- * INTERVIEW : HTML PARAGRAPH ELEMENT -->

<!-- 1: How do you create a paragraph using the <p> tag? -->
<!-- To create a paragraph, you use the <p> tag. Anything placed inside this tag will be treated as a paragraph by the browser.
     Each <p> tag automatically generates a blank line before and after it. -->

<!-- 2: Can you nest other HTML elements inside a <p> tag? -->
<!-- The <p> tag is a block-level element and cannot contain other block-level elements like other paragraphs or headings.
     However, you can include inline elements like <strong>, <em>, and links. Example: <p>This is <strong>bold</strong> text inside a paragraph.</p> -->
