    <title>Italic vs Emphasis Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<!-- Example of <em>: Semantic emphasis -->
<p>
    I <em>really</em> need your help with this project.
</p>
<!-- Explanation: The word "really" is emphasized and conveys importance to the context. Screen readers emphasize it as well. -->


<!-- Example of <i>: Non-semantic italic -->
<p>
    The scientific name of a tiger is <i>Panthera tigris</i>.
</p>
<!-- Explanation: The text "Panthera tigris" is italicized purely for stylistic purposes, such as for Latin scientific names or titles of works. -->
